Wonderful vocalist, great set list and really lovely people.  If we ever have another party we would not hesitate to book The Bees Knees, and next time maybe have the whole band!",

The band even learned a new song so my daughter could sing at our party. The lead singers voice is superb and she did a very special accoustic song which sounded brilliant. If you need a band then I recommend this one highly!",
